          <p>My background is in developing, project managing and facilitating playful and creative learning experiences for people of all ages, from toddlers all the way to the board room. When working as a school teacher, I founded the schoolâ€™s code club, and found a real passion for finding creative technical solutions and talking about code, and so, decided to train as a software engineer.</p>
          <p>I care about people, and am driven to build products which are human-focused, well designed and engaging. I am a passionate and creative strategic thinker with an eye for technical detail. I can develop powerful systems to solve problems. I am also an excellent communicator, able to explain my thinking with clarity and confidence.</p>

          <p>In my spare time I like singing and conducting in <a href="https://www.shechoir.com/london/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SHE Choir</a>, cycling around on my 80s Pinarello, making <a href="https://soundcloud.com/promband" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">synth pop music</a>, eating doughnuts and hanging out with my rescue dog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/daisy_sbt/?hl=en" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Daisy the staffy</a>.</p>
